Hyperlink.Avalonia
==========

**Hyperlink.Avalonia** provides a hyperlink variant of *TextBlock* for **[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)**.

### Documentation
There is currently only very limited documentation (incl. API docs) available. Please refer to the *DemoApp* for preliminary instructions and usage examples.

### Notes
- At this point, the library uses *Microsoft.Maui.Essentials* (v8-preview) to open the provided URL on all supported platforms. You can set IHyperlinkManager (or extend HyperlinkManager class) to customize the behaviour.
- Also, the library is probably to small and trivial for distribution via NuGet (let me know if you think otherwise).
- **The latest NuGet package is available from the '\Package' folder in this repository.**
